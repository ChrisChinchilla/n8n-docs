# Google Sheets

Use the Google Sheets node to automate work in Google Sheets, and integrate Google Sheets with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Sheets features, including creating, updating, deleting, appending, removing and getting documents. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Sheets node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [Google Sheets credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

	If your filter matches multiple rows, n8n returns the first result. If you want all matching rows: 
    	1. Under **Options**, select **Add Option** > **When Filter Has Multiple Matches**.
        2. Change **When Filter Has Multiple Matches** to **Return All Matches**.

        - **Formulas**: n8n returns the formula. It doesn't calculate the formula output. For example, if a cell B2 has the formula `=A2`, n8n returns B2's value as `=A2` (in text). Refer to [About date & time values | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/formats#about_date_time_values){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

	  	- **Formatted Text** (default): As displayed in Google Sheets, which depends on the spreadsheet locale. For example `01/01/2024`.
	  	- **Serial Number**: Number of days since  December 30th 1899. 
    - **When Filter Has Multiple Matches**: Set to **Return All Matches** to get multiple matches. By default only the first result gets returned. 

/// note | First row
n8n treats the first row in a Google Sheet as a heading row, and doesn't return it when reading all rows. If you want to read the first row, use the **Options** to set **Data Location on Sheet**.

<!-- ## Examples
This example uses the Customer Datastore node to provide sample data to load into Google Sheets. It assumes you've already set up your [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).	
	1. Set up a Google Sheet with two columns, `test1` and `test`. In `test1`, enter the names from the Customer Datastore node:  
	![The spreadsheet set up for testing](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/googlesheets/test-sheet-before.png)  
	2. Create the workflow: use the manual trigger, Customer Datastore, and Google Sheets nodes.  
	![The spreadsheet set up for testing](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/googlesheets/workflow.png)  
	3. Open the Customer Datastore node, enable **Return All**, then select **Test step**.
	4. In the Google Sheets node, go through the steps above, using these settings:
		* Select **Update Row** as the **Operation**.
		* In **Column to Match On**, select `test1`.
		* For the first field of **Values to Update**, drag in the **name** from the input view.
		* For the second field of **Values to Update**, drag in the **email** from the input view.
	5. Select **Test step**.
	6. View your spreadsheet. **test2** should now contain the email addresses that match to the names in the input data.  
	![The spreadsheet set up for testing](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/googlesheets/test-sheet-after.png)   -->

## Append an array

To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the data into a valid JSON (key, value) format. You can use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to convert the array into JSON format.
